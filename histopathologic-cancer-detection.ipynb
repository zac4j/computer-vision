Traditional methods relying on human expertise are time-consuming and prone to errors. The increasing volume of histopathological images further exacerbates this challenge. \n\nThis project aims to develop a deep learning-based model capable of accurately classifying histopathological images as cancerous or non-cancerous. By leveraging the Histopathologic Cancer Detection dataset, we will explore the potential of deep learning techniques to assist doctors in their diagnostic process. Successful implementation of this model could significantly enhance cancer diagnosis efficiency and contribute to advancements in medical image analysis.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Setup\n\nImport Tensorflow and other necessary libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.image as mpimg\nimport numpy as np\nimport PIL\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nfrom tensorflow import keras\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\n\nprint(tf.__version__)\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-19T04:37:27.266975Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-19T04:37:27.268192Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-19T04:37:40.599694Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-19T04:37:27.268154Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-19T04:37:40.598723Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"PatchCamelyon (PCam) packs the clinically-relevant task of metastasis detection into a straight-forward binary image classification task, akin to CIFAR-10 and MNIST. \n\nThe data for this project is a slightly modified version of the PCam benchmark dataset (the original PCam dataset contains duplicate images due to its probabilistic sampling, however, the version presented on Kaggle does not contain duplicates).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Exploratory Data Analysis","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pathlib\n\ntrain_path = '/kaggle/input/histopathologic-cancer-detection/train'\ntest_path = '/kaggle/input/histopathologic-cancer-detection/test'\ntrain_dir = pathlib.Path(train_path).with_suffix('')\ntest_dir = pathlib.Path(test_path).with_suffix('')\n\ntrain_imgs = list(train_dir.glob('*.tif'))\ntest_imgs = list(test_dir.glob('*.tif'))\n\nprint(len(train_imgs))\nprint(len(test_imgs))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-19T04:37:40.601882Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-19T04:37:40.602641Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-19T04:38:03.981037Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-19T04:37:40.602605Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-19T04:38:03.980108Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The dataset uses total 220025 training images, and 57458 images for testing, its too large, we'll select a subset of images for training and validation later.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Preview Images\n\nNow take a look at a few pictures to get a better sense of what the dataset look like.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Get training and testing files\ntrain_files = os.listdir(train_dir)\ntest_files = os.listdir(test_dir)\n\nprint('Training image files: ')\nprint(train_files[:10])\nprint('Testing image files: ')\nprint(test_files[:10])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-19T04:38:03.985271Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-19T04:38:03.985544Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-19T04:38:04.167927Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-19T04:38:03.98552Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-19T04:38:04.16703Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create a 4x4 plot\nnrows = 4\nncols = 4\n\n# Index for iterating over images\npic_index = 0\n\n# Set up matplotlib fig, and size it to fit 4x4 pics\nfig = plt.gcf()\nfig.set_size_inches(ncols * 4, nrows * 4)\n\npic_index += 8\nnext_train_pix = [os.path.join(train_dir, file)\n                for file in train_files[pic_index-8:pic_index]]\nnext_test_pix = [os.path.join(test_dir, file)\n                for file in test_files[pic_index-8:pic_index]]\n\nfor i, img_path in enumerate(next_train_pix+next_test_pix):\n  # Set up subplot;
