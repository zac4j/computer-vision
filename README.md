# Computer Vision Processing in Machine Learning

This repository stores the Jupyter Notebooks of the Kaggle Computer Vision related competitions I participated in before.

The competitions are:

## Image Detection

### [Histopathologic Cancer Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/learn-ai-bbc)

[![Open in Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/static/images/open-in-kaggle.svg)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dazhengzhu/histopathologic-cancer-detection) | [Notebook](https://github.com/zac4j/computer-vision/blob/main/histopathologic-cancer-detection.ipynb)

### Description

In this competition, you must create an algorithm to identify metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans. The data for this competition is a slightly modified version of the PatchCamelyon (PCam) benchmark dataset (the original PCam dataset contains duplicate images due to its probabilistic sampling, however, the version presented on Kaggle does not contain duplicates).

### Model Performance

|       |     Model Name     | Accuracy |   Score  |
|-------|:------------------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| Train | CNN                | 0.8343   |          |
|       | EfficientNet       | 0.9226   |          |
| Test  | EfficientNet       |          | 0.8483   |

## Image Generation

### [Iâ€™m Something of a Painter Myself](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started/data)

Use GANs to create art - will you be the next Monet?

- TBD
